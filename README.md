Facial Expression Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial expression recognition. The CNN is trained to classify facial expressions as either happy or sad based on input images.

Project Structure
The project directory contains the following files:

facial_expression_recognition.py: Main Python script implementing the CNN for facial expression recognition.
data/: Directory containing the dataset for training and testing the model.
models/: Directory where trained models are saved.
Usage
To use the facial expression recognition system:
Ensure that the required dependencies are installed (Users are instructed to install the required Python dependencies using pip. The dependencies include TensorFlow (including the GPU version if available), OpenCV (for image processing), and Matplotlib (for visualization)).
Prepare your dataset by organizing images into appropriate directories within the data/ directory.
Run the facial_expression_recognition.py script to train and evaluate the CNN model.
